# MisFlagger

## A web-based game developed with HTML, Tailwind CSS and Javascript which simulates a family group chat sending in misinformation messages. 

The objective of the game is to point out the red flags in misinformed messages sent by the family group chat. Each message will have a different misinformation tactic used and a specific genre on which it is misinforming - Medical, Financial, Political or general advice. 

Some of the features of the game include the following... 

* Clickable messages which opens up the analysis panel for selecting the red flags in the messages. 
* Red herrings or decoy red flags, so the player has to read the message and not select randomly
* A 10 point addition for every red flag the player spots successfully and a 5 point deduction for every red herring selected.
* The player is given 10 messages per game and is given a total score at the end with a fun little rank.
